# Self-Hosted Docker Services

This repository contains a collection of self-hosted services running in Docker containers. Each service is isolated and can be managed independently.

## Getting Started

Each service has its own directory with a `docker-compose.yml` file and a `makefile`. To start a service, navigate to its directory and run `make up`. To stop a service, run `make down`.
